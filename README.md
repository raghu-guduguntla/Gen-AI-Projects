# Gen AI Projects

Exploring Gen AI through small projects focused on solving interesting daily problems.

## About
This is a personal repository where I experiment with AI agent ideas, patterns, and workflows.  
Each project is small by design and focused on learning through practical problem-solving rather than building production-ready systems.

## What you'll find
- Small, self-contained agent projects
- Experiments with planning, reasoning, and tool use
- Notes on what worked, what didn’t, and why
- Explorations of agentic workflows for everyday problems

## Goals
- Learn how AI agents behave in real-world scenarios
- Explore different architectures and interaction patterns
- Understand trade-offs between autonomy, control, and reliability
- Keep things simple, practical, and fun

## Structure
Each folder typically represents a standalone experiment or idea, with:
- A short problem description
- The approach taken
- Implementation code
- Observations and learnings

## Status
This repository is **experimental and evolving**.  
Things may break, change, or get abandoned as new ideas come up.
